Why do we need AI to write blog posts? There’s been a trend of these AI tools to write things for you:

* https://www.notion.so/product/ai
* https://www.copy.ai/bloggers
* https://www.jasper.ai/examples/blog-posts

Imagine you have something to say to people. So you come up with some representation of that thing you want to say; maybe bullet points, maybe a rant, maybe even some markdown stuck in a GitHub repository. Why can’t you just publish that?

* it’s probably more concise. AIs seem to expand things in an unpredictable fashion
* it’s your voice! speak loud! don’t hide behind some jank code.

### Some “benefits”:

**SEO**

* Jasper advertises writing posts that’ll have better SEO
* Really short posts will be harder to find, and there’s been a trend of making medium-sized articles even when the content amount is low for ranking. Just look at recipes on Google 😕
* **I think SEO has messed up content in the last decade.**

**Misc**

* There’s a reason people don’t just publish their diaries or journals online all the time. Writing publicly requires you to adapt your mental models so that other people besides yourself can understand. Maybe AI can do this? Maybe not? 🤷
* CopyAI: You can “focus on the things you love” and free up your time from writing posts. OK, if you don’t love writing, why are you doing it? Maybe the act of creating an artifact about the thing you love can become a thing you love?

Either way, I wrote this by hand in Notion. I also drew the above graphic on my iPad — here’s what OpenAI spit out for memes:

![OpenAI image](/images/openai-robot-talking.webp "Prompt: a stick figure diagram of a person talking to a robot, which is trying to talk to a group of people. however, the robot can’t talk, and instead the person has to shout around the robot")

I probably won’t be entertaining AI writing my writings anytime soon. This is the exact type of post I like: has a strong opinion, concise, and potential for discourse. LMK if there are reasons this could be a good thing. Keep it real homies
