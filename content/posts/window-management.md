_Brief doc I'm sending to my friendos_

For transparency, I‚Äôm going to recommend a paid window switcher I use for Mac OS X called [Contexts](https://contexts.co/). It‚Äôs saved me so much time and has made using my computer a breeze; so much so, that I‚Äôve bound it to `CMD+Tab`. I‚Äôll attempt to justify this in the doc.

The default window management paradigm in Mac OS X, for me, left much to be desired. I grew up using Windows, which has a pretty different pattern for how you `Alt+Tab` between windows.

In Mac OS X, when you `CMD+TAB`, you can switch between apps; however, if you want to specify within windows of the same app, you‚Äôll have to issue another command: `CMD+`` lets you switch between windows of the same app. So you often have to issue multiple commands to get to the right window, which doesn‚Äôt even address that you often have to cycle a lot to get the app that you‚Äôre looking for.

As I‚Äôm a huge proponent of operating my computer with my keyboard as much as possible, you can get to the right ‚Äúapp‚Äù at least by using spotlight instead of `CMD+Tab`. You do `CMD+SPC` which pulls up Spotlight, and then you type in ‚ÄúChrome‚Äù or ‚ÄúChr‚Äù and then press enter. **This solves the scrolling problem** for `CMD+Tab`. However, we still have the issue of getting the right window focused.

I personally prefer the Windows paradigm of treating every window as unique, rather than grouping them by app. So, after investigating a bit, I found an app that does exactly that!

Contexts doesn‚Äôt just disambiguate between different windows of the same app, but it also lets you search for the window with a prefix of its title. So I can type in `Hold(CMD+TAB)+Sla` and I‚Äôll get Slack really quickly. Faster than I could scroll to it.

Also, if you have two chrome windows with one with calendar and the other with some other pages, you can just type in `Cal` into the window and it‚Äôll pull up.
