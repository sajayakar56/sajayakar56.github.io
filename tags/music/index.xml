&lt;p>During the holidays, I wanted to get better at answering questions like “what is 7 half steps up from A?&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>” I often found myself in the situation of having these problems as a lot of guitar chord sheets are written something like “A capo 7” which means you put the big barre thing on your guitar and play an A-shape chord. When using a capo, the actual underlying chord is &amp;lsquo;A + 7 half steps&amp;rsquo;. This means if you&amp;rsquo;re collaborating with another instrument or with someone not using a capo, you need to communicate the actual chord you&amp;rsquo;re playing. This requires some mental math, which I found slightly embarrassing as I didn&amp;rsquo;t always immediately know what chord I was playing.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
